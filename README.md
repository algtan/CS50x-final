For my final project in CS50x, I have created a mortgage calculator. This mortgage calculator can provide the user with 3 different calculations:

1) The monthly cost of a home
2) How much loan the user qualifies for
3) The amortization schedule of the loan

This information should help the user make an informed decision about their home purchase by letting them know how much it will cost them monthly, and how much home/loan they can reasonably afford.
