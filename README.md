# Mortgage Calculator
Web application that helps users make informed decisions on purchasing a home.

## Background
For my final project in CS50x, I created a mortgage calculator. This mortgage calculator can provide the user with 3 different calculations:

1) The monthly cost of a home
2) How much loan the user qualifies for
3) The amortization schedule of the loan

This information should help the user make an informed decision about any future home purchases.
